# Specification Quality Checklist: Parallel Worktree Execution

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All items pass. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed — every
decision point (waves-of-one skip worktree creation, non-git-repo
fallback, conflict reporting never auto-resolving, worktree path
convention) had a reasonable default directly supported by the
constitution (Principles I, II, III, V, VI) and the roadmap context file,
so no user clarification is required before `/speckit-plan`.
